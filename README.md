# BandSensorDump

This is my first Microsoft Band prototype app. It's a simple Windows Phone app that collects 
sensor data when you tell it to, stops when you tell it to stop, saves the readings to the 
phone as JSON and then can send the JSON files via email. 

Obviously, this is not a polished app. I wrote it quickly within the first 48 hours after I 
received my band in the mail. I wanted to see what kind of data I can get from the band before
investing much time or effort in building a real app. My goal is to collect data to improve my
weightlifting workouts.
